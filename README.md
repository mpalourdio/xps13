## Current Situation

From **A01**, linux support is quite decent. The different encountered problems can be:
 - touchpad freezing (i2c / ps2 mode)
 - no sound (or sound after 2 cold reboots of some kernels, depending on boot options)
 - ~~repeating keystroke issue (should be fixed with BIOS A01)~~ (fixed with BIOS A01 & A04)
 - ?
 
From **A02**, boot options are not needed anymore. Sound will be ok (HDA mode by default) and touchpad will be in i2c mode as ``!Windows 2013`` is not needed anymore to make audio work!  
It's still recommended to have a recent kernel (3.17+). Verify your touchpad mode with ``xinput``.  
It should give you something like ``DLL0665:01 06CB:76AD UNKNOWN`` if i2c mode is on. You could have to blacklist psmouse too. See [here](A07_02/psmouse-blacklist.conf).

BIOS **A04**: ``relevant things to linux are: keyboard repeat delay, fix an intermittent hang up at POST, update EC, update CPU microcode,  intel platform trust technology updates``

Anyway, you should upgrade BIOS to the latest version (at your own risk!). To upgrade, download the BIOS .exe, and save it in ``/boot/efi``. Double-check the checksum, reboot, press F12 and patch.

**Quote about the repeating keystroke issue (Author?)**
``Someone asked about the fix for the repeating keypresses. Yes, it was traced back to the source and will be fixed on all affected Dell platforms soon. I just saw that the one for 9343 was promoted to our factories so should be up on support.dell.com any day now as BIOS A01``
