# A19

## CONFIG #A19_01 (by [@timwienk](https://github.com/timwienk))
  * Model: XPS 13 9343-6782 (Core i7-5600U, FullHD non-touchscreen, Intel 7265 Wifi)
  * Distribution: Debian Stretch 9.8
  * Boot mode: UEFI
  * Kernel: 4.19.16-1~bpo9+1 (2019-02-07)
  * Kernel Parameters: None
  * Patches: No patches applied manually
  * Specific packages used:
    - firmware-iwlwifi (>= 20151018, non-free) - [wiki page](https://wiki.debian.org/iwlwifi)
      + *Note:* Models with broadcom card have no use for these drivers, look at [this page for Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/wl) or [this page for Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx) instead
      + Install from [backports](https://backports.debian.org/Instructions) when using Debian Jessie 8.x
  * Specific packages used for Debian Jessie 8.x only (from [backports](https://backports.debian.org/Instructions)):
    - linux-image-amd64 (>= 4.1+66)
      + With this newer kernel audio works completely (including microphone)
      + Audio still in HDA mode (if used in I2C mode on previous boot (i.e. in Windows), an extra cold boot is needed after booting once to switch to HDA)
    - xserver-xorg-video-intel (>= 2:2.99)
      + This newer version is required for DRI to work with the broadwell CPU
  * Config files:
    - Swap HDA devices: [/etc/modprobe.d/intel-hda.conf](A19_01/intel-hda.conf)
    - Blacklist psmouse: [/etc/modprobe.d/psmouse-blacklist.conf](A19_01/psmouse-blacklist.conf)
    - User specific xsession (with touchpad settings): [~/.xsession](A19_01/.xsession)
  * Untested:
    - Bluetooth
    - Actual DisplayPort output (only tested with HDMI adapter)
  * Known issues:
    - No palm detection on touchpad with "synaptics" or "multitouch" drivers, "libinput" (on Debian Stretch) does a better job
      + *Note:* When "xserver-xorg-input-synaptics" and/or "xserver-xorg-input-multitouch" are installed, default configuration prefers these over "libinput"
  * Other accessories used:
    - Dell 470-ABBT, USB 3 to Ethernet adapter (rtl8153 chip, works out of the box)
    - Dell 470-13629, Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter (works out of the box)
    - Dell 460-BBGZ, Padded sleeve with pocket (officially for 12" Dell notebooks, pocket used for accessories + charger, fits perfectly)
